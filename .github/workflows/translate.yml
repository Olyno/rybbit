            The message extraction step has just run and updated the translation files in client/messages/.
            New keys have been added with empty string values to the non-English locale files.

            Check the translation files in client/messages/. The source of truth is en.json.

            For each non-English translation file (zh.json, ja.json, de.json, pl.json, pt.json, it.json, fr.json, ko.json, es.json):
            1. Find any keys that have empty string values (these are newly extracted, untranslated strings)
            2. Find any keys in the translation file that still have English text (were not actually translated)
            3. Translate the missing/untranslated strings into the appropriate language using en.json as reference
            4. Maintain the same key order as en.json
            5. Also remove any keys that exist in the translation file but NOT in en.json (stale keys)

            Language mapping:
            - zh.json = Chinese (Simplified)
            - ja.json = Japanese
            - de.json = German
            - pl.json = Polish
            - pt.json = Portuguese (Brazilian)
            - it.json = Italian
            - fr.json = French
            - ko.json = Korean
            - es.json = Spanish

            Important:
            - Preserve {placeholder} variables exactly as they appear in the English strings
            - Keep translations natural and idiomatic, not literal
            - Maintain consistent terminology within each language file
            - Do NOT modify en.json
            - If there are no missing translations, do nothing

            After making changes, create a PR with the title "Update translations" and a summary of what was added/fixed.
