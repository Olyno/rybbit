![Funnels Dashboard](/docs/funnels/1.png)

Funnels let you define a sequence of steps — page visits or custom events — and measure how many users progress through each stage. You can see where users convert, where they drop off, and drill into the sessions at each step to understand why.

## Creating a Funnel

![Creating a Funnel](/docs/funnels/2.png)
<Steps>
<Step>
### Click "Create Funnel"
Each funnel has:

- **Name** — A label for the funnel (e.g., "Signup Flow", "Checkout Process")
- **Steps** — Two or more sequential steps, each tracking a page visit or custom event

</Step>
<Step>
### Add Steps

A funnel always must have at least two steps.

There are two types of steps: **Path Steps** and **Event Steps**.

<Tabs items={['Path Steps', 'Event Steps']}>
<Tab value="Path Steps">
Path steps match pageview events by URL path.

- Enter a URL path starting with `/`
- Wildcards are supported:
  - `*` matches a single path segment — `/products/*` matches `/products/shoes`
  - `**` matches multiple segments — `/docs/**` matches `/docs/api/v2/intro`

</Tab>
<Tab value="Event Steps">
Event steps match custom events by name (e.g., `add_to_cart`, `purchase_completed`).

Events must be tracked using the Rybbit tracking script. See [Track Events](/docs/track-events) for setup instructions.
</Tab>
</Tabs>
</Step>

### Configure Step Options (optional)

![Step Options](/docs/funnels/4.png)

Each step has additional configuration options:

- **Label** (optional) — A friendly display name for the step
- **Hostname** (optional) — Restrict matching to a specific domain, useful for multi-domain sites
- **Property Filters** (optional) — Filter by URL parameters (for page steps) or event properties (for event steps). Multiple filters can be added per step, and all must match.

</Step>
</Steps>
## Reading Funnel Results

The funnel visualization updates in real time as you configure steps. For each step, you'll see:

- **Sessions** — How many sessions reached this step
- **Conversion Rate** — Percentage of the first step's sessions that reached this step
- **Dropped** — How many sessions completed the previous step but not this one
- **Dropoff Rate** — Percentage of the previous step's sessions lost at this point

The horizontal bar for each step shows two layers:
- **Solid bar** — Overall conversion from the first step
- **Striped overlay** — Conversion from the immediately previous step

Steps are evaluated sequentially — each step must occur after the previous one within the same session.

## Viewing Sessions

![Viewing Sessions](/docs/funnels/3.png)

Click any step to expand it and view the sessions associated with that step:

- **Reached** tab — Sessions that completed this step
- **Dropped Off** tab — Sessions that reached the previous step but didn't make it to this one (available for step 2 and beyond)

Each session shows entry/exit pages, duration, location, device info, referrer, UTM parameters, and user ID if identified. Sessions are paginated.
