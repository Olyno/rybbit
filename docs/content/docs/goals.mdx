![Goals Dashboard](/docs/goals/1.png)

Goals let you define specific actions — visiting a page or triggering an event — and measure how often your visitors complete them. Each goal tracks a conversion rate against total sessions, giving you a clear picture of how effectively your site drives key outcomes.

## Creating a Goal

![Creating a Goal](/docs/goals/3.png)
<Steps>
<Step>
### Click "Create Goal"
Every goal has:

- **Name** (optional) — A friendly label like "Completed Checkout" or "Signed Up"
- **Type** — Either **Page Goal** or **Event Goal**
- **Value** — The path pattern (for page goals) or event name (for event goals)

<Callout type="warn" title="Goal type is permanent">
You cannot change a goal's type after creation. If you need a different type, create a new goal.
</Callout>

</Step>
<Step>
### Choose a Goal Type

There are two types of goals: **Page Goals** and **Event Goals**.

<Tabs items={['Page Goals', 'Event Goals']}>
<Tab value="Page Goals">
Page goals track when a user visits a URL matching a given path pattern.

- The value must be a path starting with `/` (not a full URL)
- Wildcards are supported:
  - `*` matches a single path segment — `/blog/*` matches `/blog/my-post`
  - `**` matches multiple segments — `/docs/**` matches `/docs/api/v2/intro`

The form provides autocomplete suggestions based on actual paths seen on your site.

</Tab>
<Tab value="Event Goals">
Event goals track when a custom event with a specific name is fired. The value is the event name (e.g., `signup_clicked`, `purchase_completed`).

Events must be tracked using the Rybbit tracking script. See [Track Events](/docs/track-events) for setup instructions.
</Tab>
</Tabs>
</Step>
<Step>
### Add Property Filters (optional)

![Property Filters](/docs/goals/4.png)

You can narrow a goal to only count conversions when specific properties match:

- **Page goals** — Filter by URL parameters (e.g., only count visits where `utm_source=adwords`)
- **Event goals** — Filter by event properties (e.g., only count events where `plan=premium`)

Toggle **Match specific URL parameters** or **Match specific event properties** to add filters. You can add multiple filters per goal — all filters must match for a session to count as a conversion.

</Step>
</Steps>
## Goal Metrics

Each goal card displays:

- **Total Conversions** — The number of distinct sessions that completed the goal
- **Conversion Rate** — Conversions divided by total sessions in the selected time period, shown as a percentage with a visual progress bar

Goals respect the global date range and filters (country, device, browser, etc.) applied on the page.

## Viewing Converted Sessions

![Viewing Converted Sessions](/docs/goals/2.png)

Click a goal card to expand it and see the sessions that converted. Each session shows:

- Entry and exit pages
- Session duration
- Location (country, region, city)
- Device, browser, and OS
- Referrer, channel, and UTM parameters
- User ID (if identified)

Sessions are sorted by most recent first and paginated.
